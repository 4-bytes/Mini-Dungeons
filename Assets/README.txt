*** Setup Instructions ***

If you are running the game from a Unity Project, please make sure the display settings are set to 1920x1080 (fixed resolution)
so that the game runs as expected even on different screen sizes and the scenes are fully visible.

The main playable scene is called MainMenu, and the game should be run starting from this scene.
